Energy Indicators.xls - list of indicators of energy supply and renewable electricity production from the United Nations    
scimagojr-3.xlsx - ranks countries based on their journal contributions in the aforementioned area  
world_bank.csv -  containing countries' GDP from 1960 to 2015 from World Bank. Call this DataFrame GDP.  
### [Assignment 4 - Hypothesis Testing](C1_M1A4.ipynb) 
**Hypothesis**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. 

Definitions:
* A _quarter_ is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
* A _recession_ is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
* A _recession bottom_ is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
* A _university town_ is a city which has a high percentage of university students compared to the total population of the city.


Data files:
* [Zillow research data site](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) -  housing data for the United States. ```City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv```, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
* [university towns in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States) list was copy and pasted into the file ```university_towns.txt```.
* [GDP over time](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp) of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file ```gdplev.xls```. For this assignment, only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.
